              <p>I wanna say I love you so much more than you think. I love you like a child who saw an innocent wish in you. our meeting was not a coincidence, it was a mercy from god to my heart on time. thank you for always being present, it made me see my world differently. I will continue to thank god and the days because they have presented you to my life.
                finally, t want to say just a word 
                I love  you   </p>
